If we have a DataFrame with index values Apples, ..., Potatoes, ..., and we want to select \"all the alphabetical fruit choices between Apples and Potatoes\", then it's a lot more convenient to index df.loc['Apples':'Potatoes'] than it is to index something like df.loc['Apples', 'Potatoet] (t coming after s in the alphabet).\n",

    "This is particularly confusing when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. 0,...,1000. In this case df.iloc[0:1000] will return 1000 entries, while df.loc[0:1000] return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using loc, you will need to go one lower and ask for df.loc[0:999].\n",
